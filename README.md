Rotating 3D points using matrixes. 

At the start it wasn't working, but thanks to desiado on gamedev.net, we now have a spinning cube!

The next step is to allow the user to move around the cube, Doom style.

Then after that I may add another cube, and try bounding boxes to determine if they collide.
